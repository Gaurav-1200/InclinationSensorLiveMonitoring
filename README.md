# InclinationSensorLiveMonitoring
FBG based Inclination Sensor with real-time monitoring

### Abstract
Inclinometers are widely used to measure the angle of inclination in various applications like human movement monitoring, underground drilling, level determination and other geophysical applications. FBG based inclination
sensors provide better stability, performance and resolution in comparison to its mechanical counterparts due to FBG properties of small size, low cost and immunity to EMI. In this project FBG based inclination sensor is utilised for measuring the inclination angle of an inclined platform
containing an enclosure with a pendulum by measuring the strain in the
cantilever arm of the pendulum. The angle is changed using the
micrometer connected to the platform. The setup can measure angles from
0°–3° and the sensor data is continuously sent to Firebase Realtime
Database using NodeMCU. The data from the database can be monitored
in real-time remotely using an android application.
